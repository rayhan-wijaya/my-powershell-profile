my-powershell-profile

This is my powershell profile. The cool thing about it is that paths can be
added to $PATH by editing $HOME/paths.txt, which will then be loaded by this
profile. Configs can also be written at $HOME/profile-configs.txt. Examples of
configurations may be "useNvim" or "bugnDirectory".
